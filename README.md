## Project-01: HornetAI
### PROTECTING NATIVE BIODIVERSITY With Biosecurity

![HornetAI+ÔÇô┬álogo+ÔÇô+Colour+A-02](https://github.com/SamiUddin-tech/Freelance-Depthai-OAK-Specialist/assets/81253183/70398add-43f9-4147-a144-91d279bcbb5e)

Hornet AI, designed for quick identification and monitoring of the invasive Asian hornet in Europe, is a crucial tool in wildlife management and ecological protection. It features a high-resolution camera set on a landing pad with attractants, capturing detailed images for continuous analysis. When Asian hornet presence is detected, the system sends real-time alerts, enabling prompt action by authorities. This technology is vital for distinguishing Asian hornets from native species and managing their spread, especially as sightings increase annually.

## Project-02: WaggleAI (POLLINATION ANALYSIS)
### DECODING THE HONEY BEE WAGGLE DANCE

![WaggleAI+ÔÇô+Logo+ÔÇô┬áColour+B-07](https://github.com/SamiUddin-tech/Freelance-Depthai-OAK-Specialist/assets/81253183/8073f52b-a0c7-42d3-b660-e909c67f471c)

The honey bee waggle dance is a unique form of communication used by worker bees to inform their colony about the location of food sources, indicating both the distance and direction relative to the sun. Traditionally, understanding this dance required manual interpretation, a time-intensive process. Pollenize has addressed this challenge by developing research beehives equipped with AI-powered cameras. These cameras are designed to decode the waggle dance in real-time. By doing so, the technology essentially turns bees into bioindicators, pinpointing their destinations much like a GPS. This innovative approach allows for a more efficient and precise understanding of where bees are foraging, potentially providing valuable ecological insights.

## Project-03: MothAI (MOTH ID SYSTEM) 
### DECODING THE HONEY BEE WAGGLE DANCE

![MothAI+ÔÇô+logo+ÔÇô+Black-23](https://github.com/SamiUddin-tech/Freelance-Depthai-OAK-Specialist/assets/81253183/95d8a48f-7d3f-4121-b9bd-c218e9d2e3fd)

The Moth AI Box is an innovative tool designed for monitoring and studying moth populations, an important bioindicator of biodiversity. Recognizing the significance of moths, which include over 2500 species in the UK alone, this device is particularly valuable for ecological research and conservation efforts.

Moths play a crucial role in pollination, primarily during nighttime, and have unique interactions with a variety of flowers. Many moth species are sensitive to changes in their habitat, making their populations key indicators of environmental health. Alterations in moth communities can signal changes in habitat quality or structure.

Monitoring moth populations is made efficient with the Moth AI Box, which utilizes a UV light to attract moths. This light can be controlled remotely, enhancing the convenience and feasibility of long-term studies. The device is equipped with an artificial intelligence-powered camera that periodically captures moth visitation. This setup allows for the accurate classification and identification of moth species over desired time frames, contributing to comprehensive and valuable ecological datasets.

The Moth AI Box's ability to gather extensive data over extended periods is particularly advantageous for ecological research. Its innovative use of AI technology for species identification streamlines the process of monitoring moth populations, thereby aiding in the assessment and preservation of biodiversity.
