## PROJECT: HORNET AI - PROTECTING NATIVE BIODIVERSITY With biosecurity

![HornetAI+ÔÇô┬álogo+ÔÇô+Colour+A-02](https://github.com/SamiUddin-tech/Freelance-Depthai-OAK-Specialist/assets/81253183/70398add-43f9-4147-a144-91d279bcbb5e)

Hornet AI, designed for quick identification and monitoring of the invasive Asian hornet in Europe, is a crucial tool in wildlife management and ecological protection. It features a high-resolution camera set on a landing pad with attractants, capturing detailed images for continuous analysis. When Asian hornet presence is detected, the system sends real-time alerts, enabling prompt action by authorities. This technology is vital for distinguishing Asian hornets from native species and managing their spread, especially as sightings increase annually.
