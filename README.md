## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to showcasing the expertise and projects of my Freelance Work for Companies using [LUXONIS's](https://www.luxonis.com/) [Depthai](https://docs.luxonis.com/en/latest/) and [OAK-D Stack](https://shop.luxonis.com/). It includes a variety of projects and code samples demonstrating the use of Depthai's OAK (OpenCV AI Kit) devices. The repository features real-time computer vision applications, AI models optimized for OAK devices, and custom solutions for unique client needs. My work here is aimed at providing advanced AI and computer vision capabilities, utilizing the powerful, yet compact OAK hardware for various applications. This repo serves as a portfolio and resource for those interested in employing DepthAI technology in their projects, highlighting the my proficiency in integrating AI at the edge.

## PROJECT-01: HORNET AI - PROTECTING NATIVE BIODIVERSITY With biosecurity

![HornetAI+ÔÇô┬álogo+ÔÇô+Colour+A-02](https://github.com/SamiUddin-tech/Freelance-Depthai-OAK-Specialist/assets/81253183/70398add-43f9-4147-a144-91d279bcbb5e)

Hornet AI, designed for quick identification and monitoring of the invasive Asian hornet in Europe, is a crucial tool in wildlife management and ecological protection. It features a high-resolution camera set on a landing pad with attractants, capturing detailed images for continuous analysis. When Asian hornet presence is detected, the system sends real-time alerts, enabling prompt action by authorities. This technology is vital for distinguishing Asian hornets from native species and managing their spread, especially as sightings increase annually.

## PROJECT-02: DECODING THE HONEY BEE WAGGLE DANCE

![WaggleAI+ÔÇô+Logo+ÔÇô┬áColour+B-07](https://github.com/SamiUddin-tech/Freelance-Depthai-OAK-Specialist/assets/81253183/8073f52b-a0c7-42d3-b660-e909c67f471c)

The honey bee waggle dance is a unique form of communication used by worker bees to inform their colony about the location of food sources, indicating both the distance and direction relative to the sun. Traditionally, understanding this dance required manual interpretation, a time-intensive process. Pollenize has addressed this challenge by developing research beehives equipped with AI-powered cameras. These cameras are designed to decode the waggle dance in real-time. By doing so, the technology essentially turns bees into bioindicators, pinpointing their destinations much like a GPS. This innovative approach allows for a more efficient and precise understanding of where bees are foraging, potentially providing valuable ecological insights.
